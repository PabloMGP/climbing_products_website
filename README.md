# climbing_products_website

## Redpoint Website - You can view a live version of this project [here](https://6453e9ab03ca601c7c9120a3--stately-snickerdoodle-cd22ed.netlify.app/)
This website was built using HTML, CSS with Tailwind, and JavaScript. It was my first time trying out Tailwind so really enjoyed checking out some of its features.

The website is a mobile-first design that is fully responsive. It includes a navigation bar, hamburger nav toggle, and a hero section. The website focuses on climbing products. In the future, I may consider improving it and potentially turning it into an actual business idea/store.

### Features
* Responsive design for mobile devices. 
* Navigation bar with links to different pages. 
* Hamburger nav toggle for mobile devices. 
* Hero section with an image and text.

Feel free to fork and use in your own designs.
